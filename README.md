## Installation

### build.gradle

Add `jitpack` maven in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```gradle
allprojects {
  repositories {
   ...
   maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
 }
```

Add the dependency to your app `build.gradle` file (not your project build.gradle file).
```gradle
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.github.astrit-veliu:Boom:1.1'
}
```

### Changelog
- fixed UI issue while keeping the view pressed and going outside the bound of view
- updated libs and code cleanup
- now you can use BoomUtils to add/remove effect on a view, or you can apply it to multiple views by calling only one function
- applying **Boom** effect with ripple (optional)

> **Note:** The **Version 1.1** has better support for Kotlin, you can use the full potential of **Boom** library with extension functions.
‚Äã

## Usage
`Boom` is really easy to use and gives to your Views a beautiful touch effect.

### Kotlin
In case you get a `Type mismatch` warning when passing the view as param to constructor, it needs to be casted to View.
```kotlin
  Boom(txt_header)
  Boom(cardview as View)
  imgLauncher.boom(true) //ripple effect is optional, by default is set to false
  BoomUtils.boomAll(txtHeader, materialTextButton)

  materialTextButton.removeBoom()
```
### Java
After views are binded simply pass the name of widget to Boom constructor.
```java
  new Boom(txt_header);
  new Boom(material_text_button);
```
